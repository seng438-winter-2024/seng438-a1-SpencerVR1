# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

During this lab, two initial test strategies were implemented, exploratory testing followed by manual testing. The exploratory tests proved to be a more extensive and time-consuming endeavour. It was not simple to keep track of which tests had been completed and documented in the bug report and which had not. Furthermore, it was easy to get caught up in one test that failed by searching through every iteration around it for other failures. From this perspective, it was relatively inefficient and disorganized. 

The manual functional testing was much quicker to implement, but significantly less effective. Only two bugs were discovered with the provided test suite that were not documented during exploratory testing, while many bugs found in exploratory testing were not reiterated through the second round of tests. The manual functional testing was consistent and repeatable. Both pair groups generated identical bug reports in this section. But it was constraining and less adaptable to the faults discovered in the unique software program being tested. 

Overall, neither testing strategy was flawless. The combination of both, along with regression testing after changes were made, provided a comprehensive bug search of the software.
